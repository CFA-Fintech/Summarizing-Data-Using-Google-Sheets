# Welcome!

### Welcome to Summarizing Data Using Google Sheets. 
This is a project-based course that should take approximately 2 hours to complete. Before you jumpstart the project, please, have a glance at the course objectives and structure. Summarizing vast amounts of data into a few numbers, charts, and graphs manually to gain the invaluable insights hidden in them may appear to be tedious. In this project, our focus will be on learning several graphical methods for summarizing data using Google Sheets. We will introduce you to the most commonly used methods in the business setting while focusing on how to develop them and when one is more appropriate than others. We will use Google Sheets and large data sets to illustrate how to create the summary techniques.

## Project Objectives
In this course, we are going to focus on six learning objectives.

* LOB1: Frequency Tables In Google Sheets - Quantitative Data
* LOB2: FrequencyTables In Google Sheets - Qualitative Data
* LOB3: Presenting Frequency Tables as a Bar Graph in Google Sheets
* LOB4: Histograms in Google Sheets
* LOB5: Pie Charts In Google Sheets
* LOB6: Scatter Plots In Google Sheets

By the end of this project, you will be able to use Google Sheet to construct frequency tables, bar charts, including histograms, scatter plots, and pie charts to analyze your data. So, no matter what
the field you might be in, this project is intended for you and requires no prerequisite.

## Project Structure
This hands-on project on Summarizing Data Using Google Sheet is divided into the following tasks: 

Task 1: Frequency Tables In Google Sheets - Quantitative Data

Task 2: Frequency Tables In Google Sheets - Qualitative Data 

Task 3: Presenting Frequency Tables as a Bar Graph In Google Sheets 

Task 4: Histograms In Google Sheets 

Task 5: Pie Charts In Google Sheets

Task 6: Scatter Plots In Google Sheets.
