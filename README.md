# Welcome!

## Welcome to Summarizing Data Using Google Sheets. 
This is a project that takes approximately 2 hours to complete. Before starting the project, look at the objectives and structure. Manually summarizing large amounts of data into a few numbers, charts, and graphs to get valuable information hidden in them can seem tedious. In this project, our focus will be to show various graphical methods for aggregating data using Google Sheets. We will introduce you to the most commonly used methods in a business environment, while focusing on how to develop them and when they are most appropriate. We will use Google Sheets and a large data set to illustrate how to create a summary technique.

## Project Objectives
In this project, we are going to use Google Sheet to construct frequency tables, bar charts, including histograms, scatter plots, and pie charts to analyze your data across diferent fields, disciplines or industries.

## Project Structure
This hands-on project on Summarizing Data Using Google Sheet is divided into the following tasks: 

Task 1: Frequency Tables In Google Sheets - Quantitative Data

Task 2: Frequency Tables In Google Sheets - Qualitative Data 

Task 3: Presenting Frequency Tables as a Bar Graph In Google Sheets 

Task 4: Histograms In Google Sheets 

Task 5: Pie Charts In Google Sheets

Task 6: Scatter Plots In Google Sheets.
